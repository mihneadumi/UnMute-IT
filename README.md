# UnMute-IT 
##### UnMute-IT is an innovative project that harnesses the power of Mediapipe AI technology to bridge the communication gap between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who are not proficient in American Sign Language (ASL). By combining real-time hand gesture recognition and machine learning algorithms, UnMute-IT enables users to effortlessly translate ASL signs into written text or directly to speech, facilitating effective and inclusive communication.  
##### Our solution aims to empower individuals with hearing impairments by providing them with a reliable and intuitive tool that can facilitate seamless interaction and understanding in various settings, promoting accessibility and fostering greater inclusivity in our society.
