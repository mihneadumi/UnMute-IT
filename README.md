# UnMute-IT  
#### UnMute-IT is an innovative project that harnesses the power of Mediapipe AI technology to bridge the communication gap between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who are not proficient in American Sign Language (ASL). By combining real-time hand gesture recognition and machine learning algorithms, UnMute-IT enables users to effortlessly translate ASL signs into written text or directly to speech, facilitating effective and inclusive communication.
#### Moreover, UnMute-IT goes beyond one-way translation. The app also features a speech and text-to-ASL functionality, allowing individuals who are not familiar with ASL to communicate with those who primarily use sign language. Through advanced machine learning techniques, UnMute-IT can convert spoken language or written text into accurate ASL signs in real-time. This feature further enhances the accessibility and inclusivity of the app by enabling seamless bidirectional communication between ASL users and non-ASL speakers.
#### Our solution aims to empower individuals with hearing impairments by providing them with a reliable and intuitive tool that can facilitate seamless interaction and understanding in various settings. Whether it's in educational institutions, workplaces, or social gatherings, UnMute-IT promotes accessibility and fosters greater inclusivity in our society by breaking down the barriers caused by language differences. By enabling effective communication between ASL users and non-ASL speakers, UnMute-IT contributes to a more inclusive and diverse environment for all individuals, regardless of their hearing abilities or language proficiency.
